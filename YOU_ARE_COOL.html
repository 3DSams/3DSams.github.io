    <h1>THANK YOUUUUUUUUUU</h1>
<p>I don't know if you saw the whole thing or if you just skipped to the end, either way, thank you for visiting my first website!</p>

<p>I made this website as a way to get people to know me more, there's still LOTS of things to improve and to add, this is just the start of this project.</p>
<p>This "Goofy Ahh Website" means a lot to me, as incomplete and basic as it is. As such, it means even more to me that you took the time to look at it.</p>
<p>I'll maybe post updates about twice a month as long as I can remain focused or with electricity (I hope all of the morons at Corpoelec die a terrible and agonizing death :3)</p>

<h6>that's me fr!</h6>

<p>Next update, I'll add a whole new section: <br>DSams's Goofy Ahh Music Taste</p>

<p>Well, I hope you liked what you saw, and if you didn't, maybe next update you'll find something that interests you.</p>
